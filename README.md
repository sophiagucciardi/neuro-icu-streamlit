# Analysis of Neurocritical ICU Patient Data

### Streamlit Link 

### Introduction

This streamlit app explores a dataset containing data from 4750 neurocritical ICU patients. It allows users to interact with graphs to investigate relationships between factors such as age, sex, and disease inform one another and explore statistics associated with different variables. 
The purpose of this app was not to draw conclusions with, rather to provide the user tools with which to examine correlations, general trends, and relationships. 

### Data Source & Preparation

#### Source
Ryu, Jeong-Am, 2024, "The association between arterial oxygen level and clinical outcome in neurocritically ill patients with brain tumor", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/89MI66, Harvard Dataverse, V1 

### Preparation
Because the dataset used was very clean to begin with, most of the preparation for this project involved creating columns calculated from the existing data as well as several smaller dataframes for specific use cases. 

### Future Work
A possible direction for this project to go in the future would be comparing ICU data from the same hospital this data is sourced from to investigate whether neurocritical patients there have better, worse, or similar outcomes. Additionally, comparing this data to other hospitals may also be interesting.
